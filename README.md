# Magnet Link Converter

A small application that runs in the System tray. Double click to open settings.

Watches for magnet link files (.magnet) and converts them to .torrent, then deletes the magnet.

(Doesn't actually verify that the torrent has been downloaded before deleting the magnet, which is bound to annoy someone)
